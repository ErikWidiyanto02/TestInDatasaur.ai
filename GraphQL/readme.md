# Introduction

First I define the mutation in Object. then create a function to process requests to api https://api.spacex.land/graphql/

in the run() function I import the library from python requests. then I use the post method to get the response from the SpaceX API. after getting the response then converted to a json file.
then take the ceo object that is in the data in the company
the definition is something like this [data][parent key value][child key value of company]
then validated via assetion
