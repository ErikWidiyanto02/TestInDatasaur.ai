# Introduction

this is the testcomplete file.
which I made to make it easier for me to make gerkhin syntax.
in this file there is a scenario file and a stepdefinition file based on the javascript language. each step can be filled with what action will be performed, for example, click something, fill in a textfield or validate an object.
for the priority setting I use the execution plan so that it makes it easier to set the priority. but in testcomplete you can also set the priority through these tags, the same as hooks in gerkhin syntax.
